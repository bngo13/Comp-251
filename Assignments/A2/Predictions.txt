Problem 1:
	Based on the trend of the points, I predict that the function minimizes at point (0, 0)
Problem 2:
	Based on the trend of the points, I predict the function will minimize at point (1.41, 0.18)
Problem 3:
	Based on the trend of the points, I preict the function will minimize at point (0.98, -1.93, -0.98)
